# Hello-World
This is a Hello World repository.

I know python, java, c# and R programming languages. I know statistics and I am an aspiring data scientist. I am going to learn Machine Learning from coursera's course by Andrew Ng. Even I would want to do project on Twitter sentiment analysis to get started in Data Science. I am also waiting for Coursera's course, Introduction to Data Sceince by University of Washington.
